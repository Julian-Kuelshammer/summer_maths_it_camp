/-! 𝔽₁-linear maps

This could be a project or a bonus exercise. Let's try to set up the theory of vector spaces 
over the field with one element. 

Defn: An 𝔽₁-vector space over the field with one element is a pointed set, i.e. a set 
  together with a specific point. 
  
Defn: The dimension of an 𝔽₁-vector space is one less than its cardinality.

Provide some instances of 𝔽₁-vector spaces. What is the analogue of ℝⁿ?

Defn: An 𝔽₁-linear map between V and W is a base point-preserving map such that the map 
  f: V ∖ f⁻¹ (base point) → W ∖ base point is a bijective map. 
  
Provide some examples of 𝔽₁-linear maps. 

Try to set up a theory of matrices for 𝔽₁-linear maps.
